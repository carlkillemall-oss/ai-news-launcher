# AI News Launcher

Autonomous system that scans global news, detects emerging narratives, and prepares daily token launches based on real-world trends.

---

## 🧠 Concept

AI News Launcher is an experimental autonomous agent designed to:

- Monitor global news sources
- Detect trending narratives in real-time
- Score emerging topics
- Select the most relevant daily narrative
- Automatically prepare a token launch based on that signal

No manual picking.  
No influencer coordination.  
No dev buy.  

Pure signal-driven execution.

## 🚀 Vision

The goal is to explore **autonomous on-chain creation**:

> News → Narrative → Token

Each generated token represents a snapshot of global attention at a specific moment in time.

Future iterations will include:

- AI-generated branding
- AI-generated token descriptions
- Automated image generation
- Fully autonomous token deployment

---

## 🕒 Launch Logic

The system continuously evaluates trends and selects:

**1 narrative per day**

to avoid spam and maintain signal exclusivity.

First autonomous test launch:
**23:00 GMT**

---

## 🎨 Image Generation

Tokens use automatically generated anime-style visual identities based on detected narratives.

Pipeline:

Trending News  
↓  
Narrative Extraction  
↓  
AI Image Generation

Token Metadata Creation

## 🔒 Fair Launch Philosophy

- No dev buy
- No bundled wallets
- No insider allocation
- No manual intervention

Execution is determined only by trend signals.
